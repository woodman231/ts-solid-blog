# Authorization Implementation Summary

## Problem

The `checkAuthorization` function in the `BaseService` was defined but never used in the implementation. Socket handlers were calling service methods directly without proper authorization checks, allowing users to potentially modify resources they shouldn't have access to.

## Solution: Context-Aware Service Methods

I implemented a hybrid approach that maintains SOLID principles while enabling proper authorization:

### 1. Enhanced BaseService Interface

- Added context-aware methods to `IBaseService<T>`:
  - `getAllWithContext(userId: string, options?: QueryOptions)`
  - `getByIdWithContext(userId: string, id: string)`
  - `createWithContext(userId: string, data: ...)`
  - `updateWithContext(userId: string, id: string, data: ...)`
  - `deleteWithContext(userId: string, id: string)`

### 2. Updated BaseService Implementation

- Implemented the context-aware methods in `BaseService` class
- These methods now properly call the `checkAuthorization` function before performing operations
- Authorization failures throw meaningful error messages

### 3. Enhanced PostService

- Fixed the `checkAuthorization` function to properly handle different operations:
  - `read`: Anyone can read posts (configurable)
  - `create`: Any authenticated user can create posts
  - `update`/`delete`: Only the post author can modify their posts
- Added context-aware methods that delegate to the base class
- Kept legacy methods for backward compatibility

### 4. Updated PostService Interface

- Added the new context-aware methods to `IPostService`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing methods

### 5. Updated Socket Handlers

- Modified all socket handlers to use context-aware methods:
  - `updateEntityHandler.ts`: Uses `updatePostWithContext`
  - `deleteEntityHandler.ts`: Uses `deletePostWithContext`
  - `createEntityHandler.ts`: Uses `createPostWithContext`
  - `fetchEntitiesHandler.ts`: Uses `getAllPostsWithContext`
  - `loadPageHandler.ts`: Uses context-aware methods

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Proper Authorization**

- Authorization is now enforced at the service layer
- Users can only modify their own posts
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access

### 2. **Maintains SOLID Principles**

- Single Responsibility: Services handle business logic and authorization
- Open/Closed: Easy to extend with new authorization rules
- Dependency Inversion: Authorization logic is configurable per service

### 3. **Backward Compatibility**

- Legacy methods still work for existing code
- Gradual migration path available

### 4. **Consistency**

- All socket handlers now use the same authorization pattern
- Centralized authorization logic in services

## Authorization Flow

1. **Socket Handler** receives request with `userId` from socket context
2. **Handler** calls context-aware service method with `userId`
3. **Service** calls `checkAuthorization` before performing operation
4. **Authorization Check** validates user permissions for the specific operation
5. **Operation** proceeds only if authorized, otherwise throws error

## Example Usage

```typescript
// In socket handler
const updatedPost = await services.postService.updatePostWithContext(
  userId, // User context
  entityId, // Post ID
  postData // Update data
);

// In PostService authorization config
checkAuthorization: async (
  userId: string,
  operation: string,
  entityId?: string
) => {
  if (operation === "update" && entityId) {
    const post = await postRepository.findById(entityId);
    return post !== null && post.authorId === userId;
  }
  return false;
};
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Extend to support roles (admin, moderator, etc.)
2. **Resource-Level Permissions**: More granular permissions per resource
3. **Audit Logging**: Track authorization decisions for security auditing
4. **Permission Caching**: Cache authorization results for performance

## Testing

Created `test-authorization.ts` to verify:

- Unauthorized users cannot update/delete posts they don't own
- Authorized users can create posts
- Proper error messages are returned

The implementation now properly enforces the requirement that **only post authors can edit their own posts** while maintaining a clean, extensible architecture for future authorization needs.
