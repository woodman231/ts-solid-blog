# TileView ColumnFilter Integration

## Overview

The `TileView` component has been successfully integrated with the `ColumnFilter` component, providing a more powerful and consistent filtering experience across the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. ColumnFilterConfig Interface Enhanced

- Added optional `label` property to `ColumnFilterConfig` interface
- This allows the filter configuration to specify a display label for use in TileView

### 2. TileFilterConfig Interface Removed

- The simplified `TileFilterConfig` interface has been removed
- All filter configurations now use the more powerful `ColumnFilterConfig` interface

### 3. TileView Props Updated

- Changed `filterConfigs` from `TileFilterConfig[]` to `Record<string, ColumnFilterConfig>`
- This provides better type safety and allows for more flexible filter configurations

### 4. Filter State Management

- Removed the simple `filters` state
- Now uses `columnFilters` state that works with `FilterValue` objects
- Added proper initialization of default filters
- Enhanced clear filters functionality to preserve immutable filters

### 5. UI Integration

- Replaced the simple text/select filter inputs with full `ColumnFilter` components
- Each filter now renders as a sophisticated dropdown with multiple operators
- Filters support all the advanced features from DataTable (date ranges, lookup searches, etc.)

## Usage Examples

### Before (Old TileFilterConfig)

```typescript
const filterConfigs: TileFilterConfig[] = [
  {
    key: "role",
    label: "Role",
    type: "select",
    options: [
      { value: "admin", label: "Admin" },
      { value: "user", label: "User" },
    ],
  },
];
```

### After (New ColumnFilterConfig)

```typescript
const filterConfigs: Record<string, ColumnFilterConfig> = {
  role: {
    type: "lookup",
    operators: ["in"],
    lookupOptions: [
      { value: "admin", label: "Admin" },
      { value: "user", label: "User" },
    ],
    label: "Role",
    placeholder: "Select roles...",
  },
  displayName: {
    type: "text",
    operators: ["contains", "startsWith", "endsWith"],
    label: "Name",
    placeholder: "Filter by name...",
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: "date",
    operators: ["equals", "before", "after", "between"],
    label: "Member Since",
  },
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: TileView now uses the same filtering system as DataTable
2. **Power**: Access to all filter types (text, number, date, lookup, boolean)
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple operators per filter (contains, startsWith, between, etc.)
4. **Advanced Features**: Date ranges, lookup searches, immutable filters, default values
5. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript support with proper typing

## Migration Guide

To migrate existing TileView implementations:

1. Import `ColumnFilterConfig` from `'./ColumnFilter'` instead of `TileFilterConfig`
2. Change `filterConfigs` from array to object format
3. Update filter configuration structure:
   - `key` becomes the object key
   - `type: 'select'` becomes `type: 'lookup'`
   - `options` becomes `lookupOptions`
   - Add `operators` array for supported operations
   - Add `label` for display text

## Example Implementation

See the updated files:

- `/workspace/apps/client/src/pages/users/UsersTileViewPage.tsx`
- `/workspace/apps/client/src/pages/posts/PostsTileViewPage.tsx`

Both files demonstrate the new filtering capabilities in action.
