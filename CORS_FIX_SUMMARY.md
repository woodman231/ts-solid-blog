# CORS Fix Summary

## Problem

The client application was getting CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to make HTTP requests to the `/api/user/me` endpoint on the server. This happened because:

1. The server only had CORS configured for Socket.io connections
2. Regular HTTP requests (like fetch calls) were blocked by the browser's CORS policy
3. The Express server didn't have CORS middleware configured

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added CORS Middleware

**Location**: `/workspace/apps/server/src/server.ts`

```typescript
import cors from "cors";

// Set up CORS middleware for all routes
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "*", // Allow any origin for now
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
    credentials: false, // Set to true if you need cookies/auth headers
  })
);
```

### 2. Added JSON Body Parsing

Also added `express.json()` middleware to properly parse JSON request bodies:

```typescript
app.use(express.json());
```

## Configuration Details

### CORS Settings

- **Origin**: `'*'` - Allows requests from any domain
- **Methods**: `['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS']` - Supports all common HTTP methods
- **Headers**: `['Content-Type', 'Authorization']` - Allows standard headers plus Authorization for JWT tokens
- **Credentials**: `false` - Doesn't include credentials in CORS requests (can be changed if needed)

### Dependencies

- **cors package**: Already available as a dependency of `socket.io`
- **@types/cors**: Already available for TypeScript support

## Testing Results

### 1. Regular Request

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3001/api/user/me
```

**Result**: ✅ Returns `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header with 401 (expected without token)

### 2. Preflight Request

```bash
curl -v -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3001/api/user/me
```

**Result**: ✅ Returns proper CORS headers:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,Authorization`

### 3. Development Servers

- **Server**: Running on `http://localhost:3001` ✅
- **Client**: Running on `http://localhost:3000` ✅

## Security Considerations

### Current Setup (Development)

- **Origin**: `'*'` - Allows all origins
- **Security Level**: Low (appropriate for development)

### Production Recommendations

For production, consider restricting the origin:

```typescript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: ["https://yourdomain.com", "https://www.yourdomain.com"],
    credentials: true, // If you need cookies/auth
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  })
);
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates CORS errors**: Client can now make HTTP requests to the server
2. **Supports all HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE all work
3. **Proper preflight handling**: OPTIONS requests are handled correctly
4. **Authorization support**: JWT tokens can be sent in Authorization headers
5. **Easy to configure**: Simple middleware setup with good defaults

## Next Steps

1. Test the authentication flow in the client
2. Verify that the infinite render cycle fix works with the CORS fix
3. Consider tightening CORS settings for production deployment

The CORS issue is now completely resolved, and your client application should be able to make requests to the server without any cross-origin errors.
